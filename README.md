# GenderGapEvaluation
A quick evaluation using pandas and excel data from the O*NET database to determine if there's a gender gap in analytical jobs.


The lightcast.py file contains the python script analyzing the excel sheets, going through the skills and work activities of each job to give them (based on their 6 digit code in the OCC sheets) an analytical score. The jobs are then put on a scatter plot comparing analytical score of a job to the ratio of women employed for it.
